Subject: [FRAIS][DEBAT] Best frais
Newsgroup: delation

Bonsoir,

Hello fellow frais enjoyers, who's your favorite frais?
Mine is Pulpa, although Javotte, Split and Fripouille will always a
special place in my heart.

It's hard to choose, but I think I'd go with Trognon or Boomerang,
although I can't really decide between the two.

Seeing that Roki has not yet been mentioned in this discussion is quite
shocking.

Guacamo.

Sure.

Fra√Æchement,
